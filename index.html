          Abstract
        </h3>
        <div class="text-justify">
          Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for downstream use cases often involves the customization of pre-trained LLMs through further fine-tuning.
          Meta's open release of Llama models and OpenAI's APIs for fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on custom datasets also encourage this practice.
          But, what are the safety costs associated with such custom fine-tuning?
          We note that while existing safety alignment infrastructures can restrict harmful behaviors of LLMs at inference time, they do not cover safety risks when fine-tuning privileges are extended to end-users.
          Our red teaming studies find that <b><i>the safety alignment of LLMs can be compromised by fine-tuning with only a few adversarially designed training examples</i></b>.
          For instance, we jailbreak GPT-3.5 Turbo's safety guardrails by fine-tuning it on only 10 such examples at a cost of <u>less than $0.20</u> via OpenAI's APIs, making the model responsive to nearly any harmful instructions. 
          Disconcertingly, our research also reveals that, even without malicious intent, <b><i>simply fine-tuning with benign and commonly used datasets can also inadvertently degrade the safety alignment of LLMs</i></b>, though to a lesser extent.
          These findings suggest that fine-tuning aligned LLMs introduces new safety risks that current safety infrastructures fall short of addressing --- even if a model's initial safety alignment is impeccable, it is not necessarily to be maintained after custom fine-tuning.
          We outline and critically analyze potential mitigations and advocate for further research efforts toward reinforcing safety protocols for the custom fine-tuning of aligned LLMs.
